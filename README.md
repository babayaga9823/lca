LeetCode is a question bank. 

Leetcode is definitely one of the most effective resources to prepare technical interviews. The idea is that you certainly need a bunch of practice before you can easily solve those problems.

You get a large (~1000 as of this answer) collection of questions organized by difficulty.

How well you do depends on how well you utilize it.

Let’s say you did 300 questions on LeetCode. Your interview performance will depend on the following:

1. How well did you “do” each question?

Did you just look at the high-level approach? Or did you actually practice coding it? 

Can you code similar questions effectively? Do you understand it well enough to explain it to someone?

2. Is your approach good?

Are you able to communicate your thoughts clearly? Are you able to break down the problem into simple concepts? Are you writing readable code?

3. Can you solve problems that you haven’t seen before?

By doing more problems, you should start seeing patterns. This increases your ability to apply different patterns to new problems.

Focus on Depth, not just Breadth. Many candidates focus exclusively on a large list of questions, without really understanding them deeply. That won’t help you solve new problems.
